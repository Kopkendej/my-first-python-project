def draw_mona_lisa():
    """
    Function to draw the Mona Lisa using the turtle graphics library.

    The turtle graphics library provides a way to create graphics and drawings using a turtle that can move
    around the screen. We can use this library to draw the Mona Lisa by moving the turtle in specific patterns
    and shapes.

    This function sets up the turtle window, configures the turtle's appearance and speed, and then uses a series
    of turtle commands to draw the Mona Lisa.

    Note: The turtle window may take some time to load and display the complete drawing.

    Returns:
    - None
        This function does not return any value, it simply draws the Mona Lisa on the turtle window.
